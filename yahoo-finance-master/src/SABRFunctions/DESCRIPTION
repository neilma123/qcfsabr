Description: Provides a set of functions designed specifically to calibrate and
    run the SABR model, as described in "Managing Smile risk", by Hagan et al 2002.
    Also provides a series of functions to generate the Black-76 equivalents
    of the SABR volatility and hedges, which can be used for comparative purposes.
    The package includes functions that run the three major Greeks for the Black-76
    model using SABR-calibrated Black-76-equivalent volatility as an input.
